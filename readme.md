# Software Developer - week 2

**Version 1.0.0**

This is the report from the Radium Rocket Software Developer course corresponding to week 2.

Like last week, this week a newspaper story was copied from a digital dario.
To do this, html was used to make the structure of the page, while for the design we used css language.
At the end of the page, a button that is not found in any of the original news will be included, whose function will be to exchange between the page of week 1 and the one corresponding to week 2.
